# Environments

`plot()` detects where your code is running and opens the Browzarr view in the most
convenient place for that environment. You rarely need to do anything — but here's what
happens in each context, and how to override it.

## How detection works

When you call `.plot()`, the library checks, in order:

1. **`give_url=True`** — skip opening anything; just return the hosted URL string.
2. **`external_browser=True`** — always open in your OS default browser.
3. **Jupyter / JupyterLab** — embed the view as an inline `IFrame` in the notebook
   output.
4. **VS Code** — open the view in VS Code's built-in **Simple Browser** tab (via the
   `code` CLI). Falls back to an external browser if the Simple Browser can't open.
5. **Google Colab** — serve the local port as an inline iframe via
   `output.serve_kernel_port_as_iframe`.
6. **Otherwise** — open in the OS default browser (with a note printed that the
   environment wasn't recognized).

## Behavior per environment

### Jupyter / JupyterLab

The view is rendered inline in the cell output using an `IFrame`. Size it with
`width`/`height`:

```python
bz.plot(width=900, height=600)
```

### VS Code

Opens in the built-in Simple Browser tab, so the view stays inside the editor. This
requires the `code` CLI to be on your `PATH` (it is, by default, in a VS Code
installation). If it can't open, it falls back to the external browser.

### Google Colab

Uses the Colab kernel to serve the local port as an inline iframe, so the view appears
inside the notebook without opening a new tab.

### Plain terminal / script

Opens your OS default web browser at the local server URL.

## Controlling where it opens

### `plot()` arguments

| Argument | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `give_url=True` | Return the hosted `https://browzarr.io/latest/?...` URL instead of opening anything. |
| `external_browser=True` | Force the OS browser, bypassing all detection. |
| `width`, `height` | Iframe size in Jupyter/Colab. |
| `wait` | Seconds to wait before opening (default `0.3`), so the server is ready. |

```python
# Just get a shareable URL
url = bz.plot(give_url=True)
print(url)

# Always use the OS browser, even in a notebook
bz.plot(external_browser=True)
```

---

## Local server & ports

- A **single local HTTP server** is shared across all `Browzarr` objects in a process.
  Repeated `.plot()` calls reuse it rather than spawning duplicates.
- The server binds to `localhost` and picks the **first free port starting at 8765**.
  Browsers treat `localhost` as a secure context, which WebGPU requires — so no HTTPS
  or certificate setup is needed.
- To stop the shared server and free its port, call:

```python
from browzarr.api import BrowzarrSession

BrowzarrSession.shutdown()
```
